1.How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

First we create a new folder:
mkdir "folder_name"  

Then we make it hidden with attrib:
attrib +h "folder_name"

To display it in CLI, I tried a lot of stuff like dir/a:hd but what I searched on internet didn't work on Powershell, there were possible parameters in the error message
so I tried:
ls - Hidden and ls -h  and it worked.


2.How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

mkdir -p I/hope/that/it/works
It worked



3.How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character?
echo > "first message" sometextfile.txt
echo >> "second message" sometextfile.txt

This one also works in powershell:
Add-content filename "content"
